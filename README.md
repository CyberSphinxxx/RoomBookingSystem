# Simple Room Booking System

This beginner-friendly Python program implements a basic room booking system using recursion.

Users can book rooms by providing their name and payment details.

The system keeps track of available rooms, updates the list after each booking, and asks the user if they want to make another booking.

The program demonstrates basic user input handling, condition checking, and recursive function calls.
